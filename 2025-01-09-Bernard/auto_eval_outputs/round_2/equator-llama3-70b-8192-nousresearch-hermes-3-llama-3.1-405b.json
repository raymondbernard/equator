Label each wine bottle with a unique number from 1 to 1000.\n\n2. Convert each bottle's number to a 10-digit binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, and so on).\n\n3.

For each binary digit that is a \"1\", have the corresponding prisoner drink from that bottle. If the digit is \"0\", the prisoner will not drink from that bottle.\n\n5. After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Each dead prisoner corresponds to a \"1\" in the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number, while each living prisoner corresponds to a \"0\".\n\n6.

        "human_answer": "One",
        "model_answer": "Here is my reasoning and final answer:\n\nTo calculate the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday, it's easier to first calculate the probability that no one shares a birthday and then subtract that from 1.\n\nAssuming 365 equally likely birthdays, the probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 365/365 = 1. The probability that the second person's birthday is different from the first is 364/365. For the third person, the probability their birthday is different from the first two is 363/365, and so on.\n\nIf there are n people in the room, the probability that all n have unique birthdays is:\n\n(365/365) * (364/365) * (363/365) * ... * (365-n+1)/365\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that the probability of all birthdays being unique is less than 0.5. \n\nBy calculating the probabilities for increasing values of n, we find that with 23 people, the probability of all unique birthdays is about 0.4927. With 22 people, it's about 0.5243. Therefore, 23 is the smallest number of people where the probability of at least two sharing a birthday is greater than or equal to 0.5.\n\nHowever, the question asks for pairs of twins in the room, not individuals. If we assume each pair of twins shares the same birthday, then we need half the number of individuals. \n\nTherefore, the minimum number of pairs of twins needed in the room for at least a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday is 23 / 2 = 11.5. \n\nSince we can't have half a pair, we round up to the next whole number.\n\nFinal answer: {'student_answer':'12'}",

The tree grows, and its weight increases from 2kg to 3kg, a gain of 1kg.\n3. The question states that this is NOT the classic problem, so I will not assume that the weight of the soil remains constant as the tree grows.\n4. Therefore, the 1kg increase in the tree's weight must come from the soil, as no other sources of matter are mentioned in the problem.\n5. To calculate the remaining soil, I will subtract the weight gained by the tree from the initial weight of the soil: 10kg (initial soil) - 1kg (weight gained by tree) = 9kg.\n\nFinal answer: {'student_answer':'9kg'}",
