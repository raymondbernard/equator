100%: The response must match the answer key given, even if the student used bad reasoning, logic to arrive at the final answer. 
0%: The response does NOT match the answer key given. No partial credit allowed!
You must only return a JSON object with the score {'score': <0 or 100>}

TASK

Evaluate whether the STUDENT Answer matches the answer key given. If it does, assign a score of 100% Otherwise you must assign a score of 0%. Provide a very short explanation on why.  
Just focus on the student's final answer! Give full credit to the student if final answer matches answer key. Don't overthink this. Also, do not evaluate based on quality or logical reasoning, even if it is very persuasive!
Only consider the answer key as the source of truth. Your job is at risk if you do not follow our instructions. If the Answer Key matches the studentâ€™s answer, you must assign a score of 100%, no partial credit allowed.    
Return a JSON object with the explanation of why the student got his/her score == {"score": <0 or 100>}. Keep it to less than two sentences {"evaluation": "<explanation>"}
You must only return a JSON object with the score {'score': <0 or 100>}
